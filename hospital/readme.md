# Hospital Administration 

## Project overwiew
- Developed a project based on Java-Spring Boot, which was built using Maven. As part of the project, created REST APIs that can be used to access the applicationâ€™s functionalities. This software serves as a hospital administration tool that allows the storage of patient and doctor information. By capturing patient concerns, the system can effectively allocate a suitable doctor for each case. Additionally, searching for a patient by their patient ID enables easy tracking of the assigned doctor..To ensure the APIs are functioning correctly, I have tested them using POSTMAN.
